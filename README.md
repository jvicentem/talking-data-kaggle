# TalkingData Kaggle challenge

Though the results were not good enough, I'm publishing in this repo everything I did 'cause I spent many days working on this.

What you'll find here is only a bit of all the things I tried to improve the public ROC AUC score. Some of the unpublished techniques/models I tried are: multilayer neural network, stacking, removing and adding different variables, exploring wrong predicted observations, fitting different models by hour...

My comments on the notebooks are written in Spanish. As you can see I used Spark to clean, explore and transform data: I used my computer as a driver and another computer as a worker.

I learnt a lot from this project, specially the importance of iterating fast through the project and try many things and fast to draw conclusions fast. 

I really loved the experience. 

That's all folks!
